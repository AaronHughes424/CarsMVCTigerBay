# Project Overview
There are two projects within this solution, a .NET Core Web API, and a .NET Core Web App. Both are targeting .NET 6.

The API has a basic implementation to expose a list of cars via one GET endpoint. These cars are held in-memory within a singleton repository.

The Web App is the default structure as added with visual studio - it is essentially empty.

# Tasks

- Consume the existing endpoint to show the list of cars.
- Allow a new car to be added to this list.
